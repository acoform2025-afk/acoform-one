# ACOFORM ONE – handoff notes (for the next Claude session)

**Status (28 Sep 2026):** app rebuilt from scratch (the original code was lost with the Windows PC).
All code is committed in this repo's git history. Database changes 00024–00032 are ALREADY applied
to the live Supabase project `hxlkinnosgckehogtpgb` (do not re-apply).

## Hosting (decided 28 Sep 2026)
- Hugging Face was dropped: new Docker Spaces need a paid plan on both HF accounts (402). User does not want PRO.
  NEVER touch the ACODOR Space (`acodor/acodor-door-erp-web`) – separate app.
- Now: **Render free plan**, defined in `render.yaml` (Blueprint): `main` -> `acoform-one` (live),
  `test` -> `acoform-one-test`. Render deploys after the GitHub "Check build" workflow passes.
- Free services sleep after ~15 min idle. Later: Cloudflare Zero Trust + custom domain like erp.acodor.com.
- The repo secret `HF_TOKEN` is no longer used and can be deleted.

## Database changes after the rebuild
- 00033 (28 Sep): `leads.project_name` added; lead numbers assigned automatically by trigger
  `trg_leads_assign_code` as `ACOFORM/LEAD/<FY>/001` (FY Apr–Mar). The app no longer sends `lead_code`.
- 00034 (28 Sep): `fill_quotation_from_lead` also copies `project_name`, and moves the lead to `quoted` when a
  quotation is created from it. Lead page has Create quotation / Quick quote (opens /quotations?lead=<id>[&mode=quick]).

## Built so far
Login, dashboard, settings (company, bank, engineering parameters, users), leads, quotations
(detailed + quick, accessory/transport/design lines, revisions R1/R2, proposal PDF with real logo),
projects, designs (walls → 3-strategy layout engine → server-side engineering check → approval),
BOM, production orders / work orders / QC with NCR, inventory, dispatch with delivery challan PDF,
returns and repairs.

## Waiting on the user (ACOFORM)
- Certified engineering parameters (Settings → Engineering) – designs cannot be approved until certified.
- Company legal name / GSTIN / bank details in Settings.
- Minimum custom-filler width and how to top walls above 2400 mm (layout rules).
- 4–6 site photos, optional signature/stamp PNG for PDFs.
